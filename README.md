## Heart Disease Prediction - Machine Learning Use Case

This project focuses on developing a machine learning model to predict the likelihood of heart disease in individuals. The objective is to analyze patient data and provide an accurate prediction based on various health-related factors, thereby aiding early detection and prevention strategies.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to utilize patient health data to build a predictive model for heart disease. By leveraging advanced machine learning techniques, the model identifies patterns and risk factors associated with heart disease. Data preprocessing, feature selection, and model evaluation are key aspects of this project.

## Key Features

# Data Preprocessing

Handled missing values and outliers to ensure data integrity.

Encoded categorical variables such as gender and chest pain type.

Scaled numerical features such as cholesterol levels, resting blood pressure, and maximum heart rate.

Addressed class imbalance using oversampling techniques like SMOTE.

# Feature Engineering

Derived new features from existing data to improve model accuracy.

Performed feature selection using techniques such as Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) and mutual information.

# Model Training

Implemented and compared multiple classification models:

Logistic Regression

Decision Trees

Random Forest

Gradient Boosting Machines (GBM)

XGBoost

Support Vector Machines (SVM)

## Model Evaluation

Evaluated models using the following metrics:

Accuracy

Precision, Recall, and F1 Score

Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (AUC-ROC)

# Dataset

The dataset contains features related to patient health metrics, including:

Numerical Features: Age, cholesterol levels, resting blood pressure, maximum heart rate, etc.

Categorical Features: Gender, chest pain type, exercise-induced angina, etc.

Target Variable: Presence of heart disease (1 for Yes, 0 for No)

The dataset is sourced from publicly available repositories like UCI Machine Learning Repository.

# Results

The models were evaluated on a test dataset, and the best performance achieved was:

Accuracy: 91.3%

Precision (for heart disease cases): 88.7%

Recall (for heart disease cases): 90.4%

AUC-ROC: 0.94
Detailed insights, including feature importance and confusion matrices, are documented in the final report.

# Applications

Early Detection: Identify individuals at high risk of heart disease for timely intervention.

Preventive Measures: Assist healthcare providers in recommending lifestyle changes and monitoring.

Patient Segmentation: Stratify patients into risk categories for personalized care.
